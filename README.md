# Netflix Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project involves exploring a Netflix dataset to analyze various attributes such as the type of content (Movie or TV Show), distribution of content across countries, and cleaning the dataset for inconsistencies. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains information about the movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including details like cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, and genre.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Show_id**: Unique identifier for each Movie/TV Show
- **Type**: Type of content (Movie or TV Show)
- **Title**: Title of the Movie/TV Show
- **Director**: Director(s) of the Movie/TV Show
- **Cast**: Actors involved in the Movie/TV Show
- **Country**: Country where the Movie/TV Show was produced
- **Date_added**: Date when the content was added to Netflix
- **Release_year**: Year the content was released
- **Rating**: Maturity rating of the content
- **Duration**: Duration in minutes or number of seasons
- **Listed_in**: Genre(s) of the content
- **Description**: Summary description of the content

## Issues Identified in the Dataset

- Missing values in some columns
- Incorrect data types (e.g., `date_added` column is of type `object`)
- Misplaced data, such as duration values in the `rating` column

## Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Fixing Data Types**: 
   - The `date_added` column was converted to a `datetime` type for better analysis.
   
2. **Handling Rating and Duration**: 
   - Duration values that were incorrectly placed in the `rating` column were moved to the `duration` column.

3. **Renaming and Dropping Columns**: 
   - Irrelevant columns such as `show_id` and `description` were dropped, and the `listed_in` column was renamed to `genres`.

4. **Missing Values**: 
   - Missing values were imputed using appropriate strategies. For example:
     - The `date_added` column was filled with the `release_year`'s first day.
     - Columns like `cast`, `director`, and `country` were imputed with their respective modes or default values such as 'Unknown'.

5. **Category Mapping**:
   - The `rating` column was re-categorized into broader categories like 'Kids', 'Teens', and 'Adults', and 'UR' and 'NR' values were treated as NaN.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Content Type Distribution**:
   - Analyzed the distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows in the dataset, revealing that 70% of Netflix's content is Movies, and 30% is TV Shows.

2. **Content Distribution Across Countries**:
   - Identified the top 10 countries with the most unique content on Netflix, with insights into the type of content (Movies or TV Shows) for each country.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizations were created using Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore content type distributions and content distribution by country.

## Installation

To replicate this project, you'll need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for plotting
- **Seaborn** for statistical data visualization
- **NumPy** for numerical operations

## Install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Joshua2576/netflix-dataset-analysis.git
    ```

2. Place the dataset (`netflix_titles.csv`) in the appropriate directory, or update the file path in the script.

3. Run the Python script to load, clean, and explore the data:

    ```bash
    python netflix_analysis.py
    ```

4. Review the visualizations and insights generated by the analysis.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into Netflix's content library, including content distribution by type and by country. Data cleaning steps ensure that the dataset is ready for further exploration, modeling, or use in other analysis tasks.
